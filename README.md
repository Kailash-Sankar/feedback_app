## Synopsis
A customizable lightweight feedback app

## Design Principles
Quite similar to my first design [agog](https://github.com/Kailash-Sankar/agog/edit/master/README.md). But this is a significant improvement.

## Features
- Set Categories for feedback, the icon, color theme
- General questions and rating based questions for each category
- Setup custom main feedback form
- Questions are loaded based on user rating
- Review average ratings
- View activity log
- User Roles

## Installation
 - setup virtualenv Python 2.7
 - pip on the requirements.txt
 - add and configure settings.py
 - setupd mysql db, migrate data
 - configure wsgi or run local server

## Notes
I didn't try to add too many things, so it's quite polished for a weekend project :p

## Test accounts
There are a few test accounts added through admin for testing.
